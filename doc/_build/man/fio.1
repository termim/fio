.SH OVERVIEW AND HISTORY
.sp
fio was originally written to save me the hassle of writing special test
case programs when I wanted to test a specific workload, either for
performance reasons or to find/reproduce a bug. The process of writing
such a test app can be tiresome, especially if you have to do it often.
Hence I needed a tool that would be able to simulate a given I/O workload
without resorting to writing a tailored test case again and again.
.sp
A test work load is difficult to define, though. There can be any number
of processes or threads involved, and they can each be using their own
way of generating I/O. You could have someone dirtying large amounts of
memory in an memory mapped file, or maybe several threads issuing
reads using asynchronous I/O. fio needed to be flexible enough to
simulate both of these cases, and many more.
.SH HOW FIO WORKS
.sp
The first step in getting fio to simulate a desired I/O workload, is
writing a job file describing that specific setup. A job file may contain
any number of threads and/or files \- the typical contents of the job file
is a \fIglobal\fP section defining shared parameters, and one or more job
sections describing the jobs involved. When run, fio parses this file
and sets everything up as described. If we break down a job from top to
bottom, it contains the following basic parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B IO type
Defines the I/O pattern issued to the file(s).
We may only be reading sequentially from this
file(s), or we may be writing randomly. Or even
mixing reads and writes, sequentially or randomly.
.TP
.B Block size
In how large chunks are we issuing I/O? This may be
a single value, or it may describe a range of
block sizes.
.TP
.B IO size
How much data are we going to be reading/writing.
.TP
.B IO engine
How do we issue I/O? We could be memory mapping the
file, we could be using regular read/write, we
could be using splice, async I/O, or even SG
(SCSI generic sg).
.TP
.B IO depth
If the I/O engine is async, how large a queuing
depth do we want to maintain?
.TP
.B IO type
Should we be doing buffered I/O, or direct/raw I/O?
.TP
.B Num files
How many files are we spreading the workload over.
.TP
.B Num threads
How many threads or processes should we spread
this workload over.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above are the basic parameters defined for a workload, in addition
there\(aqs a multitude of parameters that modify other aspects of how this
job behaves.
.SH RUNNING FIO
.sp
See the README file for command line parameters, there are only a few
of them.
.sp
Running fio is normally the easiest part \- you just give it the job file
(or job files) as parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ fio job_file
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and it will start doing what the job_file tells it to do. You can give
more than one job file on the command line, fio will serialize the running
of those files. Internally that is the same as using the \fI\%stonewall\fP
parameter described in the parameter section.
.sp
If the job file contains only one job, you may as well just give the
parameters on the command line. The command line parameters are identical
to the job parameters, with a few extra that control global parameters
(see README). For example, for the job file parameter \fIiodepth=2\fP, the
mirror command line option would be \fI\-\-iodepth 2\fP or \fI\-\-iodepth=2\fP\&. You can
also use the command line for giving more than one job entry. For each
\fI\-\-name\fP option that fio sees, it will start a new job with that name.
Command line entries following a \fI\-\-name\fP entry will apply to that job,
until there are no more entries or a new \fI\-\-name\fP entry is seen. This is
similar to the job file options, where each option applies to the current
job until a new [] job entry is seen.
.sp
fio does not need to run as root, except if the files or devices specified
in the job section requires that. Some other options may also be restricted,
such as memory locking, I/O scheduler switching, and decreasing the nice value.
.sp
If \fIjobfile\fP is specified as \fI\-\fP, the job file will be read from
standard input.
.SH JOB FILE FORMAT
.sp
As previously described, fio accepts one or more job files describing
what it is supposed to do. The job file format is the classic ini file,
where the names enclosed in [] brackets define the job name. You are free
to use any ascii name you want, except \fIglobal\fP which has special meaning.
Following the job name is a sequence of zero or more parameters, one per line,
that define the behavior of the job. If the first character in a line is a \(aq;\(aq
or a \(aq#\(aq, the entire line is discarded as a comment.
.sp
A \fIglobal\fP section sets defaults for the jobs described in that file. A job
may override a \fIglobal\fP section parameter, and a job file may even have
several \fIglobal\fP sections if so desired. A job is only affected by a \fIglobal\fP
section residing above it.
.sp
So let\(aqs look at a really simple job file that defines two processes, each
randomly reading from a 128MiB file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file \-\-
[global]
rw=randread
size=128m

[job1]

[job2]

; \-\- end job file \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you can see, the job file sections themselves are empty as all the
described parameters are shared. As no \fIfilename=\fP option is given, fio
makes up a \fIfilename\fP for each of the jobs as it sees fit. On the command
line, this job would look as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ fio \-\-name=global \-\-rw=randread \-\-size=128m \-\-name=job1 \-\-name=job2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Let\(aqs look at an example that has a number of processes writing randomly
to files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file \-\-
[random\-writers]
ioengine=libaio
iodepth=4
rw=randwrite
bs=32k
direct=0
size=64m
numjobs=4
; \-\- end job file \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here we have no \fIglobal\fP section, as we only have one job defined anyway.
We want to use async I/O here, with a depth of 4 for each file. We also
increased the buffer size used to 32KiB and define numjobs to 4 to
fork 4 identical jobs. The result is 4 processes each randomly writing
to their own 64MiB file. Instead of using the above job file, you could
have given the parameters on the command line. For this case, you would
specify:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ fio \-\-name=random\-writers \-\-ioengine=libaio \-\-iodepth=4 \-\-rw=randwrite \-\-bs=32k \-\-direct=0 \-\-size=64m \-\-numjobs=4
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When fio is utilized as a basis of any reasonably large test suite, it might be
desirable to share a set of standardized settings across multiple job files.
Instead of copy/pasting such settings, any section may pull in an external
\fBfilename.fio\fP file with \fIinclude filename\fP directive, as in the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file including.fio \-\-
[global]
filename=/tmp/test
filesize=1m
include glob\-include.fio

[test]
rw=randread
bs=4k
time_based=1
runtime=10
include test\-include.fio
; \-\- end job file including.fio \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file glob\-include.fio \-\-
thread=1
group_reporting=1
; \-\- end job file glob\-include.fio \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file test\-include.fio \-\-
ioengine=libaio
iodepth=4
; \-\- end job file test\-include.fio \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Settings pulled into a section apply to that section only (except \fIglobal\fP
section). Include directives may be nested in that any included file may
contain further include directive(s). Include files may not contain []
sections.
.SS Environment variables
.sp
fio also supports environment variable expansion in job files. Any
sub\-string of the form "${VARNAME}" as part of an option value (in other
words, on the right of the \(aq=\(aq), will be expanded to the value of the
environment variable called VARNAME.  If no such environment variable
is defined, or VARNAME is the empty string, the empty string will be
substituted.
.sp
As an example, let\(aqs look at a sample fio invocation and job file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ SIZE=64m NUMJOBS=4 fio jobfile.fio
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file \-\-
[random\-writers]
rw=randwrite
size=${SIZE}
numjobs=${NUMJOBS}
; \-\- end job file \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will expand to the following equivalent job file at runtime:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; \-\- start job file \-\-
[random\-writers]
rw=randwrite
size=64m
numjobs=4
; \-\- end job file \-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
fio ships with a few example job files, you can also look there for
inspiration.
.SS Reserved keywords
.sp
Additionally, fio has a set of reserved keywords that will be replaced
internally with the appropriate value. Those keywords are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$pagesize\fP \-       The architecture page size of the running system
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$mb_memory\fP \-      Megabytes of total memory in the system
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$ncpus\fP \-          Number of online available CPUs
.UNINDENT
.sp
These can be used on the command line or in the job file, and will be
automatically substituted with the current system values when the job
is run. Simple math is also supported on these keywords, so you can
perform actions like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
size=8*$mb_memory
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and get that properly expanded to 8 times the size of memory in the
machine.
.SH JOB FILE PARAMETERS
.sp
This section describes in details each parameter associated with a job.
Some parameters take an option of a given type, such as an integer or
a string. Anywhere a numeric value is required, an arithmetic expression
may be used, provided it is surrounded by parentheses. Supported operators
are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
addition (+)
.IP \(bu 2
subtraction (\-)
.IP \(bu 2
multiplication (*)
.IP \(bu 2
division (/)
.IP \(bu 2
modulus (%)
.IP \(bu 2
exponentiation (^)

For time values in expressions, units are microseconds by default. This is
different than for time values not in expressions (not enclosed in
parentheses). The following types are used:
.SS Parameter types
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBstr\fP
String. This is a sequence of alpha characters.
.TP
\fBtime\fP
Integer with possible time suffix. In seconds unless otherwise
specified, use eg 10m for 10 minutes. Accepts s/m/h for seconds,
minutes, and hours, and accepts \(aqms\(aq (or \(aqmsec\(aq) for milliseconds,
and \(aqus\(aq (or \(aqusec\(aq) for microseconds.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBint\fP
Integer. A whole number value, which may contain an integer prefix
and an integer suffix:
.sp
[\fIinteger prefix\fP]**number**[\fIinteger suffix\fP]
.sp
The optional \fIinteger prefix\fP specifies the number\(aqs base. The default
is decimal. \fI0x\fP specifies hexadecimal.
.sp
The optional \fIinteger suffix\fP specifies the number\(aqs units, and includes
an optional unit prefix and an optional unit.  For quantities of data,
the default unit is bytes. For quantities of time, the default unit
is seconds.
.sp
With \fI\%kb_base\fP =1000, fio follows international standards for unit prefixes.

With \fI\%kb_base\fP =1024 (the default), the unit prefixes are opposite from
those specified in the SI and IEC 80000\-13 standards to provide
compatibility with old scripts.  For example, 4k means 4096.
.sp
For quantities of data, an optional unit of \(aqB\(aq may be included
(e.g.,  \(aqkB\(aq is the same as \(aqk\(aq).
.sp
The \fIinteger suffix\fP is not case sensitive (e.g., m/mi mean mebi/mega,
not milli). \(aqb\(aq and \(aqB\(aq both mean byte, not bit.

specified with a \(aq,\(aq or \(aq/\(aq delimiter: 1k\-4k/8k\-32k. Also see
\fI\%int\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfloat_list\fP
A list of floating point numbers, separated by a \(aq:\(aq character.
.UNINDENT
.SS Detailed list of parameters
.sp
With the above in mind, here follows the complete list of fio job
parameters.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B name=str
ASCII name of the job. This may be used to override the
name printed by fio for this job. Otherwise the job
name is used. On the command line this parameter has the
special purpose of also signaling the start of a new
job.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B wait_for=str
Specifies the name of the already defined job to wait
for. Single waitee name only may be specified. If set, the job
won\(aqt be started until all workers of the waitee job are done.
.sp
Wait_for operates on the job name basis, so there are a few
limitations. First, the waitee must be defined prior to the
waiter job (meaning no forward references). Second, if a job
is being referenced as a waitee, it must have a unique name
(no duplicate waitees).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B description=str
Text description of the job. Doesn\(aqt do anything except
dump this text description when this job is run. It\(aqs
not parsed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B directory=str
Prefix filenames with this directory. Used to place files
in a different location than "./".
You can specify a number of directories by separating the names with a \(aq:\(aq
character. These directories will be assigned equally distributed to job
clones creates with \fI\%numjobs\fP as long as they are using generated
filenames. If specific \fIfilename(s)\fP are set fio will use the first listed
directory, and thereby matching the  \fIfilename\fP semantic which generates a
file each clone if not specified, but let all clones use the same if set.
.sp
See the \fI\%filename\fP option for escaping certain characters.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B filename=str
Fio normally makes up a \fIfilename\fP based on the job name,
thread number, and file number. If you want to share
files between threads in a job or several jobs, specify
a \fIfilename\fP for each of them to override the default.
If the ioengine is file based, you can specify a number of
files by separating the names with a \(aq:\(aq colon. So if you
wanted a job to open \fB/dev/sda\fP and \fB/dev/sdb\fP as the two working
files, you would use \fI\%filename\fP = \fB/dev/sda:/dev/sdb\fP\&. On Windows,
disk devices are accessed as \fB\e.PhysicalDrive0\fP for the first
device, \fB\e.PhysicalDrive1\fP for the second etc. Note: Windows
and FreeBSD prevent write access to areas of the disk
containing in\-use data (e.g. filesystems).
If the wanted \fIfilename\fP does need to include a colon, then
escape that with a \(aq\(aq character. For instance, if the \fIfilename\fP
is \fB/dev/dsk/foo@3,0:c\fP, then you would use
\fI\%filename\fP = \fB/dev/dsk/foo@3,0:c\fP\&. \(aq\-\(aq is a reserved name, meaning
stdin or stdout. Which of the two depends on the read/write
direction set.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B filename_format=str
If sharing multiple files between jobs, it is usually necessary
to  have fio generate the exact names that you want. By default,
fio will name a file based on the default file format
specification of jobname.jobnumber.filenumber. With this
option, that can be customized. Fio will recognize and replace
the following keywords in this string:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB$jobname\fP
The name of the worker thread or process.
.TP
.B \fB$jobnum\fP
The incremental number of the worker thread or process.
.TP
.B \fB$filenum\fP
The incremental number of the file for that worker thread or process.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To have dependent jobs share a set of files, this option can
be set to have fio generate filenames that are shared between
the two. For instance, if \fItestfiles.$filenum\fP is specified,
file number 4 for any job will be named \fItestfiles.4\fP\&. The
default of \fI$jobname.$jobnum.$filenum\fP will be used if
no other format specifier is given.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B unique_filename=:ref:\(gabool <bool>\(ga
To avoid collisions between networked clients, fio
defaults to prefixing any generated filenames (with a directory
specified) with the source of the client connecting. To disable
this behavior, set this option to 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B opendir=str
Tell fio to recursively add any file it can find in this
directory and down the file system tree.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B lockfile=str
Fio defaults to not locking any files before it does
I/O to them. If a file or file descriptor is shared, fio
can serialize I/O to that file to make the end result
consistent. This is usual for emulating real workloads that
share files. The lock modes are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBnone\fP
No locking. The default.
.TP
.B \fBexclusive\fP
Only one thread/process may do I/O, excluding all others.
.TP
.B \fBreadwrite\fP
Read\-write locking on the file. Many readers may access the file at the
same time, but writes get exclusive access.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B readwrite=str
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rw=str
Type of I/O pattern. Accepted values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBread\fP
Sequential reads
.TP
.B \fBwrite\fP
Sequential writes
.TP
.B \fBtrim\fP
Sequential trims (Linux block devices only).
.TP
.B \fBrandwrite\fP
Random writes
.TP
.B \fBrandread\fP
Random reads
.TP
.B \fBrandtrim\fP
Random trims (Linux block devices only).
.TP
.B \fBrw,readwrite\fP
Sequential mixed reads and writes
.TP
.B \fBrandrw\fP
Random mixed reads and writes
.TP
.B \fBtrimwrite\fP
Sequential trim+write sequences. Blocks will be trimmed first, then
the same blocks will be written to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fio defaults to read if the option is not specified.
For the mixed I/O types, the default is to split them 50/50.
For certain types of I/O the result may still be skewed a bit,
since the speed may be different. It is possible to specify
a number of I/O\(aqs to do before getting a new offset, this is
done by appending a \(aq:<nr>\(aq to the end of the string given.
For a random read, it would look like \(aqrw=randread:8\(aq for
passing in an offset modifier with a value of 8. If the
suffix is used with a sequential I/O pattern, then the value
specified will be added to the generated offset for each I/O.
For instance, using rw=write:4k will skip 4k for every
write. It turns sequential I/O into sequential I/O with holes.
See the \fI\%rw_sequencer\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

\fBsequential\fP is only useful for random I/O, where fio would
normally generate a new random offset for every I/O. If you
append eg 8 to randread, you would get a new random offset for
every 8 I/O\(aqs. The result would be a seek for only every 8
I/O\(aqs, instead of for every I/O. Use rw=randread:8 to specify
that. As sequential I/O is already sequential, setting
\fBsequential\fP for that would not result in any differences.
\fBidentical\fP behaves in a similar fashion, except it sends
the same offset 8 number of times before generating a new
offset.

Ordering does not matter. If the percentage is left blank,

random data and a fixed pattern. The fixed pattern is either
zeroes, or the pattern specified by \fI\%buffer_pattern\fP\&. If the
pattern option is used, it might skew the compression ratio
slightly. Note that this is per block size unit, for file/disk

.B iodepth_batch_complete=int
This defines how many pieces of I/O to retrieve

for a minimum of 1 I/O in the retrieval process from
the kernel. The I/O retrieval will go on until we
hit the limit set by \fI\%iodepth_low\fP\&. If this variable is
set to 0, then fio will always check for completed
events before queuing more I/O. This helps reduce
I/O latency, at the cost of more retrieval system calls.

.B iodepth_batch_complete_max=int
This defines maximum pieces of I/O to

.B iodepth_low=int
The low water mark indicating when to start filling

.B io_submit_mode=str
This option controls how fio submits the I/O to
the I/O engine. The default is \(aqinline\(aq, which means that the
fio job threads submit and reap I/O directly. If set to
\(aqoffload\(aq, the job threads will offload I/O submission to a
dedicated pool of I/O threads. This requires some coordination
and thus has a bit of extra overhead, especially for lower
queue depth I/O where it can increase latencies. The benefit
is that fio can manage submission rates independently of
the device completion rates. This avoids skewed latency
reporting if I/O gets back up on the device side (the
coordinated omission problem).

.B number_ios=int
Fio will normally perform IOs until it has exhausted the size
of the region set by \fI\%size\fP, or if it exhaust the allocated
time (or hits an error condition). With this setting, the
range/size can be set independently of the number of IOs to
perform. When fio reaches this number, it will exit normally

.B random_distribution=str:float[,str:float][,str:float]
By default, fio will use a completely uniform
random distribution when asked to perform random I/O. Sometimes
it is useful to skew the distribution in specific ways,
ensuring that some parts of the data is more hot than others.
fio includes the following distribution models:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBrandom\fP \-\- Uniform random distribution
.sp
\fBzipf\fP \-\- Zipf distribution
.sp
\fBpareto\fP \-\- Pareto distribution
.sp
\fBgauss\fP \-\- Normal (gaussian) distribution
.sp
\fBzoned\fP \-\- Zoned random distribution
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using a zipf or pareto distribution, an input value
is also needed to define the access pattern. For zipf, this
is the zipf theta. For pareto, it\(aqs the pareto power. Fio
includes a test program, genzipf, that can be used visualize
what the given input values will yield in terms of hit rates.
If you wanted to use zipf with a theta of 1.2, you would use
random_distribution=zipf:1.2 as the option. If a non\-uniform
model is used, fio will disable use of the random map. For
the gauss distribution, a normal deviation is supplied as
a value between 0 and 100.
.sp
For a zoned distribution, fio supports specifying percentages
of I/O access that should fall within what range of the file or
device. For example, given a criteria of:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
60% of accesses should be to the first 10%
.IP \(bu 2
30% of accesses should be to the next 20%
.IP \(bu 2
8% of accesses should be to to the next 30%
.IP \(bu 2
2% of accesses should be to the next 40%
.UNINDENT
.sp
we can define that through zoning of the random accesses. For
the above example, the user would do:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
random_distribution=zoned:60/10:30/20:8/30:2/40

similarly to how bssplit works for setting ranges and
percentages of block sizes. Like bssplit, it\(aqs possible to
specify separate zones for reads, writes, and trims. If just
one set is given, it\(aqll apply to all of them.
.UNINDENT

.B percentage_random=int[,int][,int]
For a random workload, set how big a percentage should
be random. This defaults to 100%, in which case the workload
is fully random. It can be set from anywhere from 0 to 100.
Setting it to 0 would make the workload fully sequential. Any
setting in between will result in a random mix of sequential

Comma\-separated values may be specified for reads, writes,

.B norandommap
Normally fio will cover every block of the file when doing
random I/O. If this option is given, fio will just get a
new random offset without looking at past I/O history. This
means that some blocks may not be read or written, and that
some blocks may be read/written more than once. If this option
is used with \fI\%verify\fP and multiple blocksizes (via \fI\%bsrange\fP),
only intact blocks are verified, i.e., partially\-overwritten
blocks are ignored.
.UNINDENT

.B softrandommap=bool
See \fI\%norandommap\fP\&. If fio runs with the random block map

.B random_generator=str
Fio supports the following engines for generating
I/O offsets for random I/O:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtausworthe\fP        \- Strong 2^88 cycle random number generator
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlfsr\fP                      \- Linear feedback shift register generator
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtausworthe64\fP      \- Strong 64\-bit 2^258 cycle random number generator
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tausworthe is a strong random number generator, but it
requires tracking on the side if we want to ensure that
blocks are only read or written once. LFSR guarantees
that we never generate the same offset twice, and it\(aqs
also less computationally expensive. It\(aqs not a true
random generator, however, though for I/O purposes it\(aqs
typically good enough. LFSR only works with single
block sizes, not with workloads that use multiple block
sizes. If used with such a workload, fio may read or write
some blocks multiple times. The default value is tausworthe,
unless the required space exceeds 2^32 blocks. If it does,
then tausworthe64 is selected automatically.

to calculate the number of huge pages you need for a given

.B verify_async=int
Fio will normally verify I/O inline from the submitting

.B verify_backlog=int
Fio will normally verify the written contents of a
job that utilizes verify once that job has completed. In
other words, everything is written then everything is read
back and verified. You may want to verify continually
instead for a variety of reasons. Fio stores the meta data
associated with an I/O block in memory, so for large

.B replay_no_stall=int
When replaying I/O with read_iolog the default behavior
is to attempt to respect the time stamps within the log and
replay them with the appropriate delay between IOPS. By
setting this variable fio will not respect the timestamps and
attempt to replay them as fast as possible while still
respecting ordering. The result is the same I/O pattern to a
given device, but different timings.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B replay_redirect=str
While replaying I/O patterns using read_iolog the
default behavior is to replay the IOPS onto the major/minor
device that each IOP was recorded from.  This is sometimes
undesirable because on a different machine those major/minor
numbers can map to a different device.  Changing hardware on
the same system can also result in a different major/minor
mapping.  Replay_redirect causes all IOPS to be replayed onto
the single specified device regardless of the device it was
recorded from. i.e. \fI\%replay_redirect\fP = \fB/dev/sdc\fP would cause all
I/O in the blktrace or iolog to be replayed onto \fB/dev/sdc\fP\&.
This means multiple devices will be replayed onto a single
device, if the trace contains multiple devices. If you want
multiple devices to be replayed concurrently to multiple
redirected devices you must blkparse your trace into separate
traces and replay them with independent fio invocations.
Unfortunately this also breaks the strict time ordering
between multiple device accesses.

If this is set, fio will compress the I/O logs as

compressed in the background. Given that I/O logs are
fairly highly compressible, this yields a nice memory
savings for longer runs. The downside is that the
compression will consume some background CPU cycles, so
it may impact the run. This, however, is also true if
the logging ends up consuming most of the system memory.
So pick your poison. The I/O logs are saved normally at the

Enable all of the \fBgettimeofday(2)\fP reducing options
(disable_clat, disable_slat, disable_bw) plus reduce
precision of the timeout somewhat to really shrink
the \fBgettimeofday(2)\fP call count. With this option enabled,
we only do about 0.4% of the gtod() calls we would have
done if all time keeping was enabled.

.B gtod_cpu=int
Sometimes it\(aqs cheaper to dedicate a single thread of
execution to just getting the current time. Fio (and
databases, for instance) are very intensive on \fBgettimeofday(2)\fP
calls. With this option, you can set one CPU aside for
doing nothing but logging current time to a shared memory
location. Then the other threads/processes that run I/O
workloads need only copy that segment, instead of entering
the kernel with a \fBgettimeofday(2)\fP call. The CPU set aside
for doing these time calls will be excluded from other
uses. Fio will manually clear it from the CPU mask of other  jobs.

option is used, there are two more stats that are appended,
the total error count and the first error. The error field
given in the stats is the first error that was hit during the

stands for how much should be added or subtracted to the flow

currently running and doing I/O, rate of I/O since last check (read speed
listed first, then write speed), and the estimated completion percentage
and time for the running group. It\(aqs impossible to estimate runtime of
the following groups (if any). Note that the string is displayed in order,
so it\(aqs possible to tell which of the jobs are currently doing what. The

The client number is printed, along with the group id and error of that
thread. Below is the I/O statistics, here for writes. In the order listed,
they denote:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBio=\fP
Number of megabytes I/O performed
.TP
\fBbw=\fP
Average bandwidth rate
.TP
\fBiops=\fP
Average IOs performed per second
.TP
\fBrunt=\fP
The runtime of that thread
.TP
\fBslat=\fP
Submission latency (avg being the average, stdev being the
standard deviation). This is the time it took to submit
the I/O. For sync I/O, the slat is really the completion
latency, since queue/complete is one operation there. This
value can be in milliseconds or microseconds, fio will choose
the most appropriate base and print that. In the example
above, milliseconds is the best scale. Note: in \fB\-\-minimal\fP mode
latencies are always expressed in microseconds.
.TP
\fBclat=\fP
Completion latency. Same names as slat, this denotes the
time from submission to completion of the I/O pieces. For
sync I/O, clat will usually be equal (or very close) to 0,
as the time from submit to complete is basically just
CPU time (I/O has already been done, see slat explanation).
.TP
\fBbw=\fP
Bandwidth. Same names as the xlat stats, but also includes
an approximate percentage of total aggregate bandwidth
this thread received in this group. This last value is
only really useful if the threads in this group are on the
same disk, since they are then competing for disk access.
.TP
\fBcpu=\fP
CPU usage. User and system time, along with the number
of context switches this thread went through, usage of
system and user time, and finally the number of major
and minor page faults. The CPU utilization numbers are
averages for the jobs in that reporting group, while the
context and fault counters are summed.
.TP
\fBIO depths=\fP
The distribution of I/O depths over the job life time. The
numbers are divided into powers of 2, so for example the
16= entries includes depths up to that value but higher
than the previous entry. In other words, it covers the
range from 16 to 31.
.TP
\fBIO submit=\fP
How many pieces of I/O were submitting in a single submit
call. Each entry denotes that amount and below, until
the previous entry \- eg, 8=100% mean that we submitted
anywhere in between 5\-8 ios per submit call.
.TP
\fBIO complete=\fP
Like the above submit number, but for completions instead.
.TP
\fBIO issued=\fP
The number of read/write requests issued, and how many
of them were short.
.TP
\fBIO latencies=\fP
The distribution of I/O completion latencies. This is the
time from when I/O leaves fio and when it gets completed.
The numbers follow the same pattern as the I/O depths,
meaning that 2=1.6% means that 1.6% of the I/O completed
within 2 msecs, 20=12.8% means that 12.8% of the I/O
took more than 10 msecs, but less than (or equal to) 20 msecs.

.TP
\fBio_queue=\fP

.SH TRACE FILE FORMAT
.sp
There are two trace file format that you can encounter. The older (v1) format
is unsupported since version 1.20\-rc3 (March 2008). It will still be described
below in case that you get an old trace and want to understand it.
.sp
In any case the trace is a simple text file with a single action per line.
.SS Trace file format v1
.sp
Each line represents a single I/O action in the following format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
rw, offset, length
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fIrw=0/1\fP for read/write, and the offset and length entries being in bytes.
.sp
This format is not supported in Fio versions => 1.20\-rc3.
.SS Trace file format v2
.sp
The second version of the trace file format was added in Fio version 1.17.
It allows to access more then one file per trace and has a bigger set of
possible file actions.
.sp
The first line of the trace file has to be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

The filename is given as an absolute path. The action can be one of these:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBadd\fP

.TP
\fBopen\fP
Open the file with the given filename. The filename has to have
been added with the \fBadd\fP action before.

The filename is given as an absolute path, and has to have been added and opened
before it can be used with this format. The offset and length are given in
bytes. The action can be one of these:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBwait\fP

.SH CPU IDLENESS PROFILING
.sp
In some cases, we want to understand CPU overhead in a test. For example,
we test patches for the specific goodness of whether they reduce CPU usage.
fio implements a balloon approach to create a thread per CPU that runs at
idle priority, meaning that it only runs when nobody else needs the cpu.
By measuring the amount of work completed by the thread, idleness of each
CPU can be derived accordingly.
.sp
An unit work is defined as touching a full page of unsigned characters. Mean
and standard deviation of time to complete an unit work is reported in "unit
work" section. Options can be chosen to report detailed percpu idleness or
overall system idleness by aggregating percpu stats.
.SH VERIFICATION AND TRIGGERS
.sp
Fio is usually run in one of two ways, when data verification is done. The
first is a normal write job of some sort with verify enabled. When the
write phase has completed, fio switches to reads and verifies everything
it wrote. The second model is running just the write phase, and then later
on running the same job (but with reads instead of writes) to repeat the
same I/O patterns and verify the contents. Both of these methods depend
on the write phase being completed, as fio otherwise has no idea how much
data was written.
.sp
With verification triggers, fio supports dumping the current write state
to local files. Then a subsequent read verify workload can load this state
and know exactly where to stop. This is useful for testing cases where
power is cut to a server in a managed fashion, for instance.
.sp
A verification trigger consists of two things:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Storing the write state of each job
.IP 2. 3
Executing a trigger command
.UNINDENT
.sp
The write state is relatively small, on the order of hundreds of bytes
to single kilobytes. It contains information on the number of completions
done, the last X completions, etc.
.sp
A trigger is invoked either through creation (\(aqtouch\(aq) of a specified
file in the system, or through a timeout setting. If fio is run with
\fB\-\-trigger\-file\fP = \fB/tmp/trigger\-file\fP, then it will continually check for
the existence of \fB/tmp/trigger\-file\fP\&. When it sees this file, it will
fire off the trigger (thus saving state, and executing the trigger
command).
.sp
For client/server runs, there\(aqs both a local and remote trigger. If
fio is running as a server backend, it will send the job states back
to the client for safe storage, then execute the remote trigger, if
specified. If a local trigger is specified, the server will still send
back the write state, but the client will then execute the trigger.
.SS Verification trigger example
.sp
Lets say we want to run a powercut test on the remote machine \(aqserver\(aq.
Our write workload is in write\-test.fio. We want to cut power to \(aqserver\(aq
at some point during the run, and we\(aqll run this test from the safety
or our local machine, \(aqlocalbox\(aq. On the server, we\(aqll start the fio
backend normally:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
server# fio \-\-server

and on the client, we\(aqll fire off the workload:

localbox$ fio \-\-client=server \-\-trigger\-file=/tmp/my\-trigger \-\-trigger\-remote="bash \-c \e"echo b > /proc/sysrq\-triger\e""

We set /tmp/my\-trigger as the trigger file, and we tell fio to execute

echo b > /proc/sysrq\-trigger
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
on the server once it has received the trigger and sent us the write
state. This will work, but it\(aqs not _really_ cutting power to the server,
it\(aqs merely abruptly rebooting it. If we have a remote way of cutting
power to the server through IPMI or similar, we could do that through
a local trigger command instead. Lets assume we have a script that does
IPMI reboot of a given hostname, ipmi\-reboot. On localbox, we could
then have run fio with a local trigger instead:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
localbox$ fio \-\-client=server \-\-trigger\-file=/tmp/my\-trigger \-\-trigger="ipmi\-reboot server"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For this case, fio would wait for the server to send us the write state,
then execute \(aqipmi\-reboot server\(aq when that happened.
.SS Loading verify state
.sp
To load store write state, read verification job file must contain
the verify_state_load option. If that is set, fio will load the previously
stored state. For a local fio run this is done by loading the files directly,
and on a client/server run, the server backend will ask the client to send
the files over and load them from there.
.SH LOG FILE FORMATS
.sp
Fio supports a variety of log file formats, for logging latencies, bandwidth,
and IOPS. The logs share a common format, which looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fItime\fP (\fImsec\fP), \fIvalue\fP, \fIdata direction\fP, \fIoffset\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Time for the log entry is always in milliseconds. The \fIvalue\fP logged depends
on the type of log, it will be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLatency log\fP   \-\- Value is latency in usecs
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBandwidth log\fP \-\- Value is in KiB/sec
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIOPS log\fP      \-\- Value is IOPS
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIData direction\fP is one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB0\fP                 \-\- I/O is a READ
.IP \(bu 2
\fB1\fP                 \-\- I/O is a WRITE
.IP \(bu 2
\fB2\fP                 \-\- I/O is a TRIM
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIoffset\fP is the offset, in bytes, from the start of the file, for that
particular I/O. The logging of the offset can be toggled with \fI\%log_offset\fP
.sp
If windowed logging is enabled through \fI\%log_avg_msec\fP then fio doesn\(aqt log
individual IOs. Instead of logs the average values over the specified
period of time. Since \(aqdata direction\(aq and \(aqoffset\(aq are per\-I/O values,
they aren\(aqt applicable if windowed logging is enabled. If windowed logging
is enabled and \fI\%log_max_value\fP is set, then fio logs maximum values in
that window instead of averages.
